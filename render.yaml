# Note: This deployment assumes that the `c1_fakenews_weights.pt` file is present in your repository.
# If the `bert-base-uncased` model and its weights are very large, you may need to use a paid Render plan
# for more RAM and storage. You can check the size of the model and the project to estimate the required resources.
